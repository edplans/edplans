,Kindergarten,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,"The Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts emphasize the critical importance of building nonfiction background knowledge in a coherent and sequenced way within and across grades. This can be accomplished most effectively, at each grade level, by integrating the topics from history, geography, science, and the arts in the Core Knowledge Sequence into the language arts block. Note that in the Sequence, there are many cross-curricular connections to history and science topics within Language Arts (e.g., poems, stories, and sayings), as well as to visual arts and music, which can and should be integrated into the applicable domain of study.For Kindergarten, domains include: An Overview of the Seven Continents; Native American Peoples, Past and Present; Early Exploration and Settlement; Presidents, Past and Present; Plants and Plant Growth; Animals and Their Needs; The Human Body; Introduction to Magnetism; Seasons and Weather; Taking Care of the Earth.NOTE: The objectives listed in sections I–IV of Language Arts below are consistent with the Core Knowledge Language Arts program and embed all of the skills and concepts within the Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,I. LISTENING AND SPEAKING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,"Teachers: Shortly after a baby is born, an amazingly complex, interactive communication process begins between the infant and others in his/her environment. While it may seem like an obvious statement, it is nonetheless worth making the point that listening and speaking are the primary means of communication throughout the early years of a young child’s development. It should be equally obvious that reading and writing competencies are predicated on competencies in listening and speaking. When a child enters kindergarten, however, traditional language arts instruction has typically accorded little, if any, attention to the ongoing development of children’s listening and speaking ability. We have acted as if listening and speaking competencies are fully and firmly established and can be left behind, as reading and writing instruction begins. Nothing could be further from the truth. This omission in language arts instruction has been a serious oversight. We must remedy this oversight, deliberately elaborating and extending listening and speaking skills, while we simultaneously begin to introduce reading, and then writing. Children who are fortunate enough to participate in language arts instruction that recognizes the importance of continuing to build listening and speaking competency while also beginning reading and writing instruction will, in the end, be far more literate adults.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,C. COMPREHENSION AND DISCUSSION OF READ-ALOUDS—ALL TEXTS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,"Teachers: Written text makes use of richer vocabulary and more complex syntax than conversational language. It is important that young children be exposed not only to the language of everyday conversation but also to the richer and more formal language of books. This can be done through frequent reading aloud. Helping young children develop the ability to listen to and understand written texts read aloud must be an integral part of any initiative designed to build literacy.At the kindergarten level, a child’s ability to understand what he hears far outpaces his ability to independently read and understand written text. By listening to stories or nonfiction selections read aloud, children can experience the complexities of written language without expending cognitive energy on decoding; they can likewise access deeper and more complex content knowledge than they are presently able to read independently.Careful consideration should be given to the selection of books read aloud to ensure that the vocabulary and syntax presented is rich and complex. Leveled texts will not provide the rich language experience desired during read-alouds and should only be used as a starting point with students for whom English is a second language.Grade appropriate read-aloud selections for poetry and fiction are included on pages 9–11. Nonfiction read-alouds should be selected on the basis of the history, science, music and visual art topics identified for kindergartners in the Core Knowledge Sequence, with emphasis on history and science read-alouds. It is strongly recommended that daily readalouds focus on a single topic over a sustained period of time—about two weeks—rather than intermingling read-alouds on a variety of subjects. Careful consideration should be given to the order in which nonfiction read-alouds are presented to ensure that knowledge about a topic builds in a progressive and coherent way.Following any read-aloud, children should participate in rich, structured conversations with an adult in response to the written text that has been read aloud. In this way, they can begin to orally practice comparing, analyzing, and synthesizing ideas in written text in much the same way as they will be expected to do as independent readers in the later grades.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kindergartners can, however, express themselves in writing by drawing pictures and, as they begin to learn some of the code, copying or writing words, phrases, and sentences.In addition, students can also participate in shared writing exercises modeled and scaffolded by an adult. The focus in shared writing should be on encouraging the students to verbally express themselves coherently and in complete sentences, as the teacher serves as a scribe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The poems listed here represent some of the most popular and widely anthologized titles; children may certainly be introduced to more Mother Goose rhymes beyond the selection below. Although children are not expected to memorize the following rhymes, they will delight in knowing their favorites by heart, and will experience a sense of achievement and satisfaction in being able to recite some of the rhymes.Note Regarding PRESCHOOL Content: Some of the poems and stories specified here are appropriate for preschoolers. Indeed, one would hope that most preschoolers would come to kindergarten having heard, for example, some Mother Goose rhymes or the story of “Goldilocks and the Three Bears.” However, as not all children attend preschool, and as home preparation varies, the Core Knowledge Sequence offers a core of familiar rhymes and stories for all kindergarten children.

Writing).The following works constitute a core of stories for this grade. In kindergarten, these stories are meant to be read-aloud selections. Expose children to many more stories, including classic picture books and read-aloud books. (In schools, teachers across grade levels should communicate their choices in order to avoid undue repetition.) Children should also be exposed to nonfiction prose: biographies, books on science and history, books on art and music, etc. And, children should be given opportunities to tell and write their own stories.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

World History and Geography,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Kindergarten,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,"Teachers: In kindergarten, children often study aspects of the world around them: the family, the school, the community, etc. The following guidelines are meant to broaden and complement that focus. The goal of studying selected topics in World History in Kindergarten is to foster curiosity and the beginnings of understanding about the larger world outside the child’s locality, and about varied civilizations and ways of life. This can be done through a variety of means: story, drama, art, music, discussion, and more.The study of geography embraces many topics throughout the Core Knowledge Sequence, including topics in history and science. Geographic knowledge includes a spatial sense of the world, an awareness of the physical processes that shape life, a sense of the interactions between humans and their environment, an understanding of the relations between place and culture, and an awareness of the characteristics of specific regions and cultures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduce children to the seven continents through a variety of methods and media (tracing, coloring, relief maps, etc.), and associate the continents with familiar wildlife, landmarks, etc. (for example, penguins in Antarctica; the Eiffel Tower in Europe). Throughout the school year, reinforce names and locations of continents when potential connections arise in other disciplines (for example, connect Grimm’s fairy tales to Europe; voyage of Pilgrims to Europe and North America; story of “Momotaro—Peach Boy” to Asia [Japan]; study of Native Americans to North America).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mathematics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Kindergarten,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,"Teachers: Mathematics has its own vocabulary and patterns of thinking. It is a discipline with its own language and conventions. Thus, while some lessons may offer occasional opportunities for linking mathematics to other disciplines, it is critically important to attend to math as math. From the earliest years, mathematics requires incremental review and steady practice: not only the diligent effort required to master basic facts and operations, but also thoughtful and varied practice that approaches problems from a variety of angles, and gives children a variety of opportunities to apply the same concept or operation in different types of situations. While it is important to work toward the development of “higher-order problem-solving skills,” it is equally important—indeed, it is prerequisite to achieving “higher order” skills—to have a sound grasp of basic facts, and an automatic fluency with fundamental operations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,"Teachers: Effective instruction in science requires hands-on experience and observation. In the words of the 1993 report from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Benchmarks for Science Literacy, “From their very first day in school, students should be actively engaged in learning to view the world scientifically. That means encouraging them to ask questions about nature and to seek answers, collect things, count and measure things, make qualitative observations, organize collections and observations, discuss findings, etc.”While experience counts for much, book learning is also important, for it helps bring coherence and order to a child’s scientific knowledge. Only when topics are presented systematically and clearly can children make steady and secure progress in their scientific learning. The child’s development of scientific knowledge and understanding is in some ways a very disorderly and complex process, different for each child. But a systematic approach to the exploration of science, one that combines experience with book learning, can help provide essential building blocks for deeper understanding at a later time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
